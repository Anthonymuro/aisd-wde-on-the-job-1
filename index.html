    <div class="service">
        <h3>General House Cleaning</h3>
        <p>Our team provides thorough cleaning services for every room of your home, leaving it spotless and fresh.</p>
		<p>
			General house cleaning extends beyond basic tidying up; it's about creating a space that is not only visually appealing but also contributes to overall well-being. A well-maintained home promotes mental clarity and reduces stress, making it easier to relax and enjoy your surroundings. Cleaning regularly helps in controlling dust mites, pet dander, and mold, all of which can trigger allergies and respiratory issues. By staying consistent with tasks like wiping down surfaces, disinfecting high-touch areas such as doorknobs and light switches, and keeping floors free of dirt, you’re actively contributing to a healthier living space.

        <h3>Deep Cleaning</h3>
        <p>General house cleaning extends beyond basic tidying up; it's about creating a space that is not only visually appealing but also contributes to overall well-being. A well-maintained home promotes mental clarity and reduces stress, making it easier to relax and enjoy your surroundings. Cleaning regularly helps in controlling dust mites, pet dander, and mold, all of which can trigger allergies and respiratory issues. By staying consistent with tasks like wiping down surfaces, disinfecting high-touch areas such as doorknobs and light switches, and keeping floors free of dirt, you’re actively contributing to a healthier living space.
         A thorough cleaning routine should also include organizing clutter. Tidying up closets, drawers, and common areas makes it easier to find what you need and enhances the overall flow of your home. In addition to surface cleaning, paying attention to details like wiping baseboards, dusting ceiling fans, and refreshing linens adds a finishing touch that elevates the cleanliness of your space. By scheduling specific days for certain tasks, like laundry, floor cleaning, or window washing, you can break down house cleaning into manageable parts and avoid feeling overwhelmed. The result is a more efficient, well-maintained home where everything feels fresh and in order.</p>
